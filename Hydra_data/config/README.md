### 40x40x20mm fan on bullseye duct
First of all, I had a bullseye duct from before that had a 40x40x10mm fan on it, but recently I swapped that fan out for a 40x40x20mm fan, which in turn was thicker and the screws wouldn't fit. 
In order to fix this, I decided to drill a hole just large enough for the head of the screw about halfway down the screw holes of the new fan, which in turn allowed me to countersink the screws and get them to reach!

Cheat sheet for soldering: 
On my printer, the Blue fan wire was negative, and the yellow wire was positive.
