##How To Modifications:

### New Controller Fan

Recently I added a new fan for the controller board to replace the old 40mm one with a bad bearing. I actually ended up replacing it with a 50mm fan and I cut a hole in the side of the printer and the fan mounts there and gets some nice airflow! Overall its a good improvment as previously, the 40mm fan didnt really have a vent, so it was just recycling warm air, and it had to run at full speed and wasn't even pushing that much air, but with this new fan you can have it run at about 65% speed and it still pushes more air and is much quieter!
